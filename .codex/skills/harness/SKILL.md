# Harness Project Discipline

Use this skill whenever you are planning, implementing, reviewing, or verifying code in this Harness CLI project.

## Operating Rules

1. Treat `harness info`, Harness generators, and `harness audit` as mandatory project controls.
2. Run `bun run dev -- info <topic>` or `bun run dev -- info scaffolds --json` before creating unfamiliar code shapes.
3. For non-trivial work, ask what the loop should prove, search templates, then create or continue a `harness loop`.
4. Prefer adding or updating generators over manually duplicating scaffold behavior.
5. Add or update unit and temp-workspace E2E tests for generator, audit, and CLI behavior changes.
6. Keep generated and hand-edited files inside the configured Harness rule limits.
7. Verify with `bun run check` before handing work back.

## Bug and Regression Loops

- Use `harness loop create <name> --from bug-fix --goal <text>` for bug repairs: reproduce with a failing test before implementation, then repeat repair and the same unchanged test until it passes.
- Use `--from regression-prevention` for regressions requiring durable prevention: identify the root cause, propose the repair and guard, implement both, and include the guard in normal project verification.
- Prove the guard rejects reintroducing the original failure in an isolated fixture or temporary workspace; restore the repair and prove the guard passes.
- Record failing and passing commands, assertions, and results as step evidence. Keep green/guard/verification steps pending while proof fails; the agent retries repairs and checks. Harness does not launch an AI repair runner or automatically complete steps.
- For affected UI paths, exercise the browser flow and capture fresh screenshots, then inspect the images before recording proof. Report blockers without claiming completion.
