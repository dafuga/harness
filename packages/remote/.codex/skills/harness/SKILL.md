# Harness Project Discipline

Use this skill whenever you are planning, implementing, reviewing, or verifying code in this Harness Bun TypeScript library.

## Operating Rules

1. Treat `harness info`, Harness generators, and `harness audit` as mandatory project controls.
2. Run `harness info <topic>` or `harness info scaffolds --json` before creating unfamiliar code shapes.
3. For non-trivial work, ask what the loop should prove, search templates, then create or continue a `harness loop`.
4. Prefer `harness generate <kind> <name>` for supported scaffolds, then adapt the generated file within Harness limits.
5. Add or update the feature spec first so the intended behavior is explicit before implementation.
6. Keep generated and hand-edited files inside the configured Harness rule limits.
7. Use `harness info clean-code` for optional Jev review; preview coverage before enabling it, use a project-owned credential, and assess advisory results before gating.
8. Verify with `bun run check` before handing work back.

## Bug and Regression Loops

- Use `harness loop create <name> --from bug-fix --goal <text>` for bug repairs: reproduce with a failing test before implementation, then repeat repair and the same unchanged test until it passes.
- Use `--from regression-prevention` for regressions requiring durable prevention: identify the root cause, propose the repair and guard, implement both, and include the guard in normal project verification.
- Prove the guard rejects reintroducing the original failure in an isolated fixture or temporary workspace; restore the repair and prove the guard passes.
- Record failing and passing commands, assertions, and results as step evidence. Keep green/guard/verification steps pending while proof fails; the agent retries repairs and checks. Harness does not launch an AI repair runner or automatically complete steps.
- For affected UI paths, exercise the browser flow and capture fresh screenshots, then inspect the images before recording proof. Report blockers without claiming completion.
